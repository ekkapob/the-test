### Program information
- developed on MacOS High Sierra (10.13.1)
- written in Node.js (v9.5.0)
- npm (5.6.0)
- uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) JavaScript test framework

### Basic Installation
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ekkapob/the-test.git
$ cd the-test
$ npm install
$ npm start # to run the program
$ npm test # to run all tests
```

### Program Limitations
Problem #1 and #3 have limit of the sequence number set to 1,000,000 and 100 respectively. This prevents maximum stack exceeding error and infinity sequence value.

Problem #2 always returns Y value of 55 regardless of any inputs. Because only Y value of 55 is the proof of the mathematical problem, (Y + 24) + (10 Ã— 2) = 99.

### Possible Problems
Running tests on Windows might have some problems. Path to run `npm test` in package.json is set to `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha` (Linux based) which is not supported on Windows system. It would need to be changed to `node_modules\mocha\bin\mocha`.
